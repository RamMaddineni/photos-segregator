Goal: Build a fully client-side web application where the user can drag and drop a folder of images, and the app detects all unique persons across the images using face recognition, then creates separate folders for each person containing all the images in which that person appears, and finally provides a downloadable ZIP file containing these folders.

1. Initialize a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project structure.
2. Include face-api.js library via CDN or install it if using a bundler.
3. Include JSZip library for zip file creation.
4. Load the necessary face-api.js models (TinyFaceDetector, FaceLandmark68Net, FaceRecognitionNet).
5. Create a drag-and-drop area that can accept a folder using the DataTransfer API and webkitGetAsEntry to recursively read all files.
6. Filter the dropped files to only include valid image types like .jpg, .png.
7. For each image file, create a bitmap or canvas element and run face-api.js to detect all faces and extract descriptors.
8. Collect all face descriptors along with their source image reference into a list.
9. Use a clustering algorithm like DBSCAN or KMeans to group face descriptors into clusters representing unique individuals.
10. For each cluster, map which images contain at least one face from that cluster.
11. For each unique person cluster, create a virtual folder and copy all related image files into it.
12. Use JSZip to generate folders in memory and add image files accordingly.
13. Generate a zip blob from the JSZip instance and create a download link for the user.
14. Provide a progress indicator or status updates for long operations like model loading, face detection, and zip generation.
15. Optionally use IndexedDB to cache results or allow reprocessing without repeating all steps.
16. Test the app on a variety of image sets with different people counts and overlapping individuals.
17. Deploy the app using static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or local server) since no backend is required.
